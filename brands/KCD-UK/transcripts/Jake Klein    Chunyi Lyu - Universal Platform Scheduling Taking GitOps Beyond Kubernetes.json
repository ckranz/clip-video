  "text": "Okay let's get started Hopefully all of you are having an amazing morning an amazing start at the conference The talk is going to be about GitOps Just to introduce ourselves first we're from Syntaso I'm a software engineer at Syntaso it's been about a year and a half at the company Before that I was doing platform engineering and communities related works at VMware And Hi nice to meet everybody My name is Jake I'm also an engineer at Syntaso Prior to that I was working at WeWorks for a few years and prior to that at Pivotal Okay cool So the talk is going to be mostly focusing on GitOps but before we get started I just want to have a few words about Kratix itself first So Kratix is an open source platform framework that we're building here at Syntaso One of its core functionalities is the ability to schedule workloads to different types of destinations and we're using GitOps to achieve that And Kratix also is built and runs on top of Kubernetes and therefore we're at KCDUK So really GitOps is at the core of how Kratix works Okay a bit of a refresher What is GitOps So GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and application code using Git as a single source of truth You would express your infrastructure setup and your application in code and then you inject that into Git That would include everything from how to scaffold your Kubernetes cluster to specific software that you're running in your environment or your application configuration as And then you have automation setup that watches these Git repos and then reconciling your environment to making sure that everything is in Okay so some core principles of GitOps So first your system must be declarative You don't say how to get to the desired state You simply express the desired state in code in a written document and then you check that into And because all of your changes are tracked in Git changes are going to be versioned and you cannot rewrite history The history is going to be immutable And when we're talking about a GitOps agent it's going to watch these Git repos and changes are going to be pulled automatically It's not going to be a one off action it goes to the continuous reconciled principle as well Like actions are not going to be performed once you're not just going to reconcile once and then forget about it It's going to keep reconciling and making sure that there's no drift Whenever the agent detects any kind of drift it's going to apply over that and making sure to bring the environment back in line Okay so what would that look like in the context of Kubernetes you would have a couple or one Git repository that are tracking all of your Kubernetes manifest that would include maybe your config map your deployment your stateful set or some Kubernetes operator that you're depending on like server manager or maybe like a in house chart that you're building and distributing to the rest of your organization And then you have your GitOps operator So your GitOps agents are either Argo or Flux they're great they're builds and runs on top of Kubernetes and they will be configured to watch your Git repos and usually they're also deployed in cluster to where they're applying the changes to They're going to pull the latest version that you have in your Git repos and then apply them to the Kubernetes API and from there Kubernetes take over and is going to make sure that the actual state in your cluster matches the desired state And just to re emphasize on some of the principles that we talked about earlier the one on pull automatically and continuous reconciliation all of these areas they're not going to be a one off action It's going to be continuously performed same for the agents same for the Kubernetes API Okay so benefits for doing GitOps why you should consider adapting it if you haven't done so First it's easy to audit because GitOps really is emphasizing on the fact that you should express as much as you can in a written document and then you check that into a Git repo where people with the right permission they can view these changes and all of your changes are going to be tracked and versioned as well So you're no longer relying on somebody's memory or maybe a Slack spread that you can never find or some email conversation to check out the context You can go to the Git repo and then look at the changes and also with a comprehensive history as well And the second point is on it's easy to recreate your environment because we're using Git is versioned and it also emphasizes on automation to set up environments so in you can check out an earlier commit and take a look at what that environment looks like at that point in time and even recreate your environment for that And third is on developer autonomy so teams don't have to push out changes by creating a ticket and waiting for an operation team to act on that They can push out and propose changes by pushing to the repo directly that has GitOps set up or they can just create some PRs And third point is on reducing human errors because they really emphasize on automation there's less of a need for human intervention human actions so hopefully it's going to reduce the risk on human error happening and impacting your environment Okay so now I'm going to pass it to Jake and he's going to talk about how we're using GitOps in Thank you So like Ginny was describing there's lots of value in using GitOps and we knew when we were writing Credix we wanted to make sure we leveraged this So the basic premise of Credix is that it's a platform orchestrator it's there to help you schedule workloads and deal with all the services you need to offer in your platform And obviously a big part of that is you're using Kubernetes and deploying things to Kubernetes So we have this basic idea that your platform is probably going to schedule workloads to various Kubernetes clusters distributed all around the world on different cloud providers and we needed a way to easily be able to do that So like we talked about we wanted to leverage GitOps but just saying that alone isn't enough right How do you go about doing that How do you make sure it scales and it works quite smoothly So we realized that we needed to introduce a component into Credix to make it easy to schedule workloads to different Kubernetes clusters So we started with the idea of okay we can write a scheduler in Credix You can give it some declarative manifests and the scheduler will take care of writing it to the right Git repository in the right directory in the right branch that will be synced by the right cluster Now that was easy enough but how do you actually make it useful in an API that's quite easy to interact with And that was where we looked in the ecosystem for some existing examples So the most obvious one and the one that we decided to utilize was the nodes examples in Kubernetes So if you've ever spun up a Kubernetes cluster and registered nodes you'll create a node you'll assign some labels to it and when a pod's being deployed it can say hey I want to go to this particular node And we decided to apply the exact same principle that they're scheduling GitOps documents to different Kubernetes clusters So the idea being that you would register a Kubernetes cluster we call that a destination with Credix and you would associate a set of labels with it So in this case you might say labels about the region you might say what capacity it has like does it have GPU nodes for example You can imagine this could be quite complex You could be saying which cloud the Kubernetes cluster is in which version it is any set of properties that make sense for your organization you can apply that This approach was quite nice It's unsurprising to Kubernetes users right Lots of people are used to label selectors and all that sort of stuff So it was quite nice So the basic idea we wanted to support to begin with was a platform engineer could say hey there's this workload that I want to schedule to multiple Kubernetes clusters and I want to do it via GitOps Just go and do it for me So in this case it could give you something like Kubeflow and it could say here's a manifest for Kubeflow Schedule it to all of the Kubernetes clusters that actually support Kubeflow as in they have GPU nodes available So in this case Kratix would take that declarative document write it to the right Git repositories for the right Kubernetes clusters and have them be synced by those end And because it's using the label system it would know OK this particular cluster in this case EUS3 doesn't have this label Therefore I'm not going to write this declarative document to the state store and it won't be synced Once you've achieved that you can then start doing more granular scheduling So in this case you might say a developer might come to the platform and say great I want to take advantage of Kubeflow I want to train my model Go ahead and schedule this workload to me And then the user's just coming to the platform and requesting this The platform can then say OK I know I have these clusters that have Kubeflow already installed and I know they're compatible So when a user says they want to schedule this I can just go ahead and schedule it to the workload for them So this is quite a nice approach It made it easy for people to interact with the platform It made it easy for the platform to leverage GitOps And it just provided quite a nice simple experience But what we learned is that this doesn't just apply to Kubernetes It applies beyond that So I'm going to hand it over to you to talk about that Cool So because we're talking about GitOps here at the context of Kubernetes and usually people think about it as Kubernetes cluster plus a GitHub agent of your choice like Argo and But just going back to the earlier to the starting point of our talk GitOps is about a set of practice and principles And so at the core of it it's you express your desired state and then you check that you're using Git as a single source of And then you have automation that reacts to these written documents and then reconciling an environment So technically if you have seen a software that can react to written that can be configured by a written document it can do GitOps So that's true for Kubernetes right Kubernetes is all about declarative states You tell the API what the declarative state is through a YAML manifest and then Kubernetes takes care of it from there It's also true for using Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise to manage your infrastructure It's also true for Backstage as well So Backstage developer catalog they're all your components and templates that showed up in your Backstage are all configured through YAML manifest too So if you identify that reconciliation behavior based on written document you can use GitOps to manage it And you're not limited in terms of the tool that you have to use So we oftentimes are talking about Flux and Argo in the context of K8s because they're built on K8s they run on K8s they're K8s native they're great people loves it But you're not limited to those two either So we're all using CICD If you're on GitLab you're probably using GitLab pipelines If you're on GitHub you have GitHub repos you're probably using Actions as well So you can use those tools too So you can use GitOps agents that are pulling changes from your repo like Flux and Argo But at the same time you can also have your CICD setup that reacts to pushes commits to your GitHub repos and then relying on CI pipelines to push out changes to environment They may look kind of different in practice but it's achieving the same goal at the end of the day And that flexibility is really powerful Because if you have to adapt a different tool to do this like if you haven't used Argo or Flux before we know that adapting a new tool is always going to have a cost on the team on the engineers But we're always using some sort of CICD already So you can rely on your existing tool to adapt GitOps And in Kratix we embrace this flexibility We don't care which mechanism that you're using to reconcile the It's still when we're scheduling works and managing workloads by it's just under the same GitOps contract Okay so bring it back the story to Kratix a little bit Imagine that you are a platform engineer and you and your teams are maintaining and deploying Kratix serving that to the rest of your organization And the demand has grown You are in the Maybe like three or two months ago you're scheduling workloads to a bunch of Kubernetes clusters and that was it But now the demand has grown so you're scheduling workloads to your Terraform cloud account your Terraform enterprise your Ansible And things are working fine They are reconciling successfully However as time goes you feel like the visibility into the health and the status of your more of a challenge for you Because in the old world when things are all running in Kubernetes you can rely on your Kubernetes dashboard that are reporting the statuses of all of your running pod It's nothing fancy but it works And it's a consistent way of looking at the status and the health of all of your running workloads But now because you have workloads that are running in different type of destination they all have their own different way They have their different language to express the status of the running workloads And as the platform engineer you kind of have to switch environments switch the different mental models when you have to check on the statuses of all of your workloads And it really just adds friction to our experience You feel like it's adding unnecessary cognitive load to maintaining critics running critics for your organization So we got this feedback from a user and we started asking these questions about how we can pass information back from destination to critics itself And we're thinking about maybe we need a new type of connection Maybe we need to introduce an external database to get that information passed back And that's not really ideal right Because we're talking about our enterprise users And generally if you're introducing a new type of connection you need to have new security sign off You need to have permission tickets created It may take months to resolve them if it's even possible to resolve them in the end So that's additional requirements to deploy critics and additional complexity for a to mind about as well We just wanted to solve this problem without introducing that Okay So we looked at our existing architecture and we said okay wait a We already have a way of passing information from critics to our destination right Because critics is scheduling workload to destinations through state store It writes the workload document to the state store and then you have to get all the agents in the destination that look at these state stores and then reconcile the work this way But so far the communication has been one directional We're pushing workloads from critics to the destination But nothing is saying that we can't use the same state store to pass information back from the destination to critics right If we're solving problems in this way we're not introducing a new type of destination Therefore there's no new security sign off or tickets created that's necessary for our users So that's the solution that we landed on So we said that we're going to use our state store as a bidirectional communication channel In the old days critics would pass on workloads that it wants to schedule to our destination through the state store And now we're saying that the destination can also write information back through the state store So they're going to write information back to the state store and then critics will react to that This way includes all different type of destination It's not just limited to Kubernetes cluster It's the same for if using critics to configure your developer catalog for your backstage instance or your Terraform enterprise account They can all pass information back to critics by writing that in the existing state store Then we say that we're going to have GitOps agents that are also deployed in the platform cluster where critics is running These GitOps agents are going to pull the information from the state store apply them to the platform cluster and then critics will simply react to them by updating statuses of the corresponding resource requests or the manifest Now as the platform engineer you have a consistent way of viewing the statuses and the health of your workloads You can stay in the platform cluster the same context and then you can check on the statuses of all of your resources and it's a coherent and consistent way of presenting that information for you Essentially this is a health check and we solve this problem by leveraging our existing architecture and by using GitOps again Okay now I'm going to pass it back to Jake and he's going to speak about GitOps beyond Git Awesome Thank you As many of you might have noticed in this diagram we're using the Git repository in the middle as a way of communicating information back and and a lot of you might be thinking does that really scale When you're pushing out changes to Kubernetes clusters you're doing that through It's probably quite a low rate of change You might change every few minutes maybe every few hours But if you're pushing information back to the platform cluster this might actually happen more often If you're health checking a critical application or a database or something like that you might want to be pushing information back every minute or every few seconds or whatever sort of configuration you want So we quickly realized that this actually might not scale very well You might have hundreds of Kubernetes clusters all of them managing their own hundreds of workloads within them all of them wanting to push information back to the platform about the health of those workloads And if you're doing that via Git you might have some problems So one solution could be that you just introduce more Git repositories but that doesn't really solve the problem right We're just sort of pushing it out a little bit You're still going to have the same bottlenecks at the end of the day So this sort of comes back to like why are we using Git So GitOps started as the main trend Like Ginu was describing there's lots of benefits to using Git You get that nice history We're all developers that are familiar with it You can encourage people to PR in changes And it's just a very good user experience But there's cons of it right You can't deal with concurrent pushes You're going to get lots of conflicts If you're using things like webhooks on pushes it's going to be even more messy So then we started to think about OK actually does this need to be Git So at the end of the day we're looking for a place where you can declare what you want the state of the world to be and a system can reconcile it So another example of that could be S3 You could write documents to an S3 bucket and still have a system converge on it You're losing some of the benefits of GitOps being able to have that commit history that easy ability to contribute But you're trading it off for like a higher throughput So in this case you could write documents about the status of the work that you're deploying really frequently because S3 scales really nicely I should say this is S3 compatible so you could be using an open source product as well or any of the cloud providers that use different S3 APIs But now you've lost the GitOps part that you liked You've lost the ability to go and look at the commit history and see OK what changes were made So we realized that actually we shouldn't limit you We should let you use a combination of both So you could use Git for when you're pushing out information out to your clusters when the platform is pushing out changes You use Git so you get a nice history that you like But when you're pulling information back out from the cluster and into Kubernetes or into Kratix you can use a different system And this sort of mixing and using the right system for the right scenario we think is quite nice We're not limiting you You can push data out via one mechanism and pull it back via another So it doesn't just stop at S3 Control Plane recently put out a blog where they're talking about what would a Gitless GitOps architecture look like which is quite fun An example they gave was using OCI So those of you familiar with Docker images a Docker image follows the OCI spec And essentially it's just storing some documents in an OCI registry So nothing stops you from actually using the same principle of storing YAML So you could use a tool like OREST to build a Docker image that just contains YAML manifest in the day and push that to your registry The power of OCI is that it's pretty secure I think a lot of us are familiar that you get things like S bombs You get immutability You can sign the creation of these artifacts You get better more fine grained authentication You're not giving access to a whole Git repository where you've got shared documents You're just giving access to one particular image in that And it's just got a lot of nice aspects to it But then you have to come back to why we were using GitOps to begin with If you're losing that sort of user nature of being able to go and look at the commit history and all that sort of stuff it's an interesting trade off about using you know should you use this Should you use Git Should you use S3 And we think the flexibility of being able to choose between them is really important You need to choose the right solution for the right problem So adding OCI support to Cradix is something that's on our backlog to add support for So in summary in this talk we talked about GitOps and why it's really powerful We talked about how it's a principle that doesn't just apply to Kubernetes Any system where you can declare or you can converge on a declared state in a Git repository S3 pack or anything like that is essentially doing GitOps We talked about the importance of tracking the health of your workloads particularly once you scale this out beyond Kubernetes If you're using different systems you need a way of putting all that information back in And we talked about how GitOps doesn't just mean Git So this is it for the talk Me and Chinyu will be at our booth later today to come and talk to us We're also giving a workshop later today as well It's the Working Code Win Workshop We'll be sort of walking through what it's like to build a using Cradix alongside some open source tools And our colleagues Kat and Derek will be giving a talk tomorrow on adding observability to Cradix as well So thank you all for Thank you",
