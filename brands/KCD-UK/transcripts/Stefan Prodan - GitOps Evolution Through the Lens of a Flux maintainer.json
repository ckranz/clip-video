  "text": "Hi everyone I'm very happy to be here it's a special talk for me I'm going to go down the memory line how we get to the GitOps idea how we build Flux around it and where I'm seeing this movement going forward I'm going to start explaining a little bit the context of how we got to GitOps in the first place So this was very early on I think Kubernetes was still not 1 0 there was no Kubernetes deployment object or I was at WeWorks back then and we were building a SaaS offering for a hosted Prometheus So we were trying to get people on Prometheus run it as a service and of course we tried to run it on Kubernetes There were back then no Kubernetes installer no nothing we had to build our own build Kubernetes from source code deploy it on AWS I think PMs and so on with the automation we had back then in place So doing this exercise of building a control plane from scratch deploying apps there we kind of figured out that Kubernetes allows you to do things easier than systems before And I think the major shift was declarative versus imperative Everybody here knows Terraform or maybe before that you worked with Puppet Chef other technologies Anybody here work with Puppet Yeah my kind of crew yeah It was not that great It was the right tool for that moment I think Puppet was GitOps before GitOps was a word The problem also with Terraform and running infrastructure running deployments in an imperative way I would call it is the third state The system that you are addressing to that you are trying to program does not have its own discoverable state So you need to keep this third state The Terraform state files Puppet has its own database Chef has its own approach to this So you can't just look at a system and ask the system hey in which state are you now When you change the system in an imperative way you run some command on it to install a package to start up your application to register your application in system D or whatever you were doing back then You need to track all these operations that you've done and store them in this third state that you have to manage Then in order to determine what's the next thing I have to do you can't just ask the system You have to look at what you did in this history compare it and so on Kubernetes kind of from my perspective this is where the biggest shift happened back then was you can actually ask the system and the system will tell you exactly what's going on It was very fast It has a really good API You no longer had to guess what's happening This allowed the new era of continuous delivery where you can build on top of this declarative model a way of continuously reconciling the desired state So instead of poking around and moving from one stage to another oh I have a new version of the app Let's see in which stage the old version is Deploy the new version then pause And if the new version you know runs into issues or whatever you don't know You have to run something again like a CI job So we used to do these kind of operations as a one off While with Kubernetes because declarative has this fast API knows its current state we can move away from one offs to having a system that understands itself has self healing and can actually have this continuously reconciling idea Another big shift back then was this debate between pull and push right And I think from the Cloud Native projects Prometheus actually encouraged this kind of mind shift Instead of you having to instrument all your applications and the application have to go to the monitoring system and say yes I'm up or these are the things that I'm doing currently The reverse of this the system comes to the application discovers the application somehow And of course this is the magic of Kubernetes CNI and so on We have the system that allows other tooling to do the discovery part It comes to the application and takes from the application the right So Git also is a combination at the beginning of these two shifts Like we are now dealing with a system which is purely declarative We can query it very fast And don't need to rely on other things pushing the state We can do pulling We can look outside the system find the desired state and pull it inside the cluster And we can make this continuously right Now when we started with Flux we had some misconception let's say We were probably way too I don't know We thought everybody knows Git Like everybody should know Git right You are a developer You definitely know Git So it's easy We are going to replace kubectl with the Git CLI It turned out I don't know even if developers know Git they don't quite like it or they don't quite understand it that much So maybe Git is not the perfect tool to replace kubectl but that was the idea back then right Another thing we assume is that if we teach app developers this new paradigm like Kubernetes being declarative Prometheus discovering your apps and everybody or all the developers will all of the sudden love to do operations They'll love it right It's no longer you don't have to write like puppet templates or learn a new language like tooling like Terraform It's like they'll love operations It's purely declarative It's YAML like they do with configuration all the time It will be great It turned out after so many years everybody hates it So maybe we were overreaching So how we got the first version of Flux I joined we worked in 2017 Flux was already built inside one year before The first version of Flux was very simple Remember back then there were no Kubernetes CRDs That was not the concept of extending Kubernetes with custom resources I don't think the deployment controller was there It was called replica How is it called Replica controller right So in the first version of Flux how this thing was designed was we assume you will be able to deploy Flux on every cluster as a Kubernetes pod and you configure through arguments and environment variables like any application where the desired state is It will give you the Git address and SSH key And once you have Flux on all your clusters Flux will go to the single repo and synchronize everything everywhere There were some limitations to this first iteration of Flux One major limitation was if you wanted to change anything in the configuration of Flux you had to change its deployment its pod The second major limitation was and back then we didn't feel like it was a limitation Later on we did One cluster could only follow one Git repo right So because we thought why wouldn't you store everything in one Git repo Kubernetes is a monorepo right We were doing also other applications Everybody in our world go was monorepos So nothing can go wrong You can put everything in a repo Everything should turn fine And this worked for a couple of years GitOps was no longer you know something that five people knew about It started to gain traction Other projects came into being Argo CD there was a spin off of Jenkins called Jenkins X Does anyone remember Jenkins X Has anyone used Jenkins X Wow okay Okay okay yeah But with you know like all new technologies there is this graph like you have an idea there is let's say a project that shows that that idea can be successful then it's an explosion of options right There were at some point I think I we have at least like there were like six tools at least that were trying to do GitOps right Now we are in a stage where it's Flux it's Argo and I don't know Anything else comes in mind Do you use anything else for GitOps There are some products from the cloud vendors I think there is a Google config sync stuff like that which are very specific to a cloud vendor But after so many years of GitOps there's that explosion a lot of tools a lot of experimentations and then you know this is how the market works in the way There are one or two winners and everything else is lost in time So yeah we got to this stage early on where we had these limitations Thing was we're starting we've seen Flux being adopted in production systems and the next thing we've built in Flux which was let's say quite revolutionary back then was the idea that in order to change the system you have to commit something to the app image They'll have to open let's say a pull request or commit directly to this monorepo the config repo and bump the image version right Early on the feedback was developers don't want to go to this config repo and do this thing manually What if we want to deploy 10 times per day I'm going to create 10 commits changing from version 1 0 1 to 1 0 2 and so on It's redundant right We don't want to do it So we've built in Flux a thing called image automation which basically you say Flux scan my repo find the latest version according to some policy let's say a symbol expression and so on and if a new version is pushed to the repo commit that to Git and maybe open a pull request someone merge it or you merge it automatically and that's how you know you do continuous delivery Because if you don't have any kind of automation on that side the continuous delivery involves a lot of humans dealing with YAMLs in the Git repo So that after we've built image automation and that gave app teams velocity into what they're doing that we've seen a major adoption of GitOps and Flux of course And in 2019 we donated Flux to CNCF and that's when things got really big Also the competition was very serious So we were hitting all these limitations Flux was built as a monolith It had code in there that with all the Git operations It had code in there that dealt with the desired state changing the cluster state talking to the Kubernetes API and code in there that would scan registries connect to these external systems and so on So the next evolution was rebuilding Flux from scratch and with only the GitOps concepts being the same but the software completely changed And not many projects are successful doing a whole rewrite I think we were I'm still here I'm talking to you So Flux version two we started five years ago a complete rewrite with a different mindset where we separated and we created Kubernetes controllers we CRDs and these controllers are dedicated for their scope For example we have in Flux a thing called source controller This controller only deals with going to the Git repo going to OCI registries and so on And it's scoped also in terms of security in terms of RBAC That controller cannot change the cluster state And there were two reasons why we did this split One was for of course security concerns and all of that We also wanted to have a diversity of you know maybe you have more than one Git repo where you store your things But we also wanted to make contributions easier When you have this monolithic approach it's very hard If you change something in the source code it can affect so many parts It's very very hard It was very hard with Flux one at some point to get contributions in So we wanted to you know allow people to come with their ideas into the Flux project and expand Flux that way So separating Flux into many controllers each with a dedicated scope and you know well defined API After we've built it we kind of tripled our number of contributors The community grew a lot and we've seen huge adoption also in you know enterprises cloud vendors who started to use Flux internally for their own deployments and also offering Flux as a service to their users like Azure for example offers Flux version 2 to users Another major thing we've built in Flux version 2 was getting the cluster bootstrap having this as you know a really well thought process that had a good user experience And we created the Flux CLI that has a single command called bootstrap You run that and everything you point it to a cluster and the whole cluster gets bootstrapped all the applications all your cluster components in the right order with dependencies between them and so on You can also create the main Git repo for you It can then allow you to connect from this repo to any other sources of truth And we also made the decision that Git should not be the only way you can define the desired state And we first added as an option to Git S3 and buckets as another option right You will say like okay but S3 is not version Why would you do that We did this integration with buckets and it's not only about AWS Any kind of S3 compatible API works here due to high regulated systems There are high regulated industries There are places where okay Git is part of the development workflow but when it comes to the only place where something from the cluster can access is a database and a bucket right So that was the first implementation where we say okay you can build some kind of automation in Git push to the bucket and then Flux will connect from there and Flux will never reach out outside your trust zone The issue with this process was that when you run the bootstrap command we need access to your Git repo to push the Flux manifest Because in Flux version 2 the idea was if Flux is made to deploy other applications Flux should be able to deploy itself And that was one of the design principles So we when you run bootstrap we commit all the Flux manifest to the repo and Flux then takes its desired state from there What that means is that after the cluster bootstrap you don't have to touch the cluster anymore You don't need Kubernetes API access You deploy all your apps through the desired state but you can also upgrade Flux make changes to the whole system through Git and Flux will upgrade itself and change itself more like you know how Chrome does it or other browsers We wanted to bring that kind of automation into the system and it was a really nice way of dogfooding our own technology right If we can Flux version 2 is quite complex has a bunch of CRDs 14 CRDs six controllers now there are seven If we can manage to orchestrate all of that then any other application will be easy Okay so we got to the stage where you know Flux can take things from the desired state and deploy the app Now the next problem we had to solve was okay the new version of the app comes into production Everybody you know lands up on the new version What if the new version is broken right So we extended Flux with another project called Flagger which is part of the Flux project it's under CNCF and comes with this idea of progressive delivery The idea is when you change the desired state and let's say you push a new version on your app instead of all your end users landing on the new version you can define a policy Here is the policy is called the Kennedy it's a custom resource and then Flagger can talk to your ingress your service mesh whatever it is there in front to shift traffic between the two versions So we kind of added a layer that gives developers more confidence in a way that it's okay to fail it's okay to do a bad deployment because you can easily catch it and you don't expose everything to the end and also Flagger can quickly do a rollback without you having to go in Git and change the files So until here it was almost everything about Git and Git was basically part of your production system unless you use the bucket And three years ago we came out with this idea where what if we adopt the open container initiative we build an OCR artifact for Flux and Flux like Docker now has a push command a build command and so on and we unify everything under the registry And the idea here was in order to run a Kubernetes cluster you need a container registry right It's how your apps get deployed So what if we reuse the container registry to also store there all your configurations your Helm chart the whole desire state so it's app code plus configuration plus policies then you can sign everything in the same way you can verify everything in the same way and then clusters become more reliable If GitHub goes down or GitLab both of them go down pretty often I would say right If you adopt GitOps you are basically having these systems even if you run your own Git instance you have these systems as a dependency of your production cluster right And it's quite hard to secure all your Git servers and so on and make it part of production With this approach basically you build some CI that runs the Flux push command maybe runs a cosign sign command and so on and you can reuse your current CI workflows and deal with configuration in the same way you are dealing with containers today And we've seen this adopted by banks and other large institutions because they like the idea of having a single store for code and configuration being able to sign all things in the same way and Flux has integration for verifying all the things Of course we had integration with we can verify Git commits and so on but the signature of a Git commit is tied to a the one that has committed In this new world of OCI artifacts the signature is made in CI it's part of your system You can also have attached an SBOM so you know what was the environment where that configuration was built and so on So it gives you a better understanding of the whole workflow Okay so the last stage of the Flux evolution and how we see GitOps is at Control Plane we are developing this Flux operator which is also an open source project it's built on top of the Flux APIs It tries to solve a lot of issues that we've seen over the years with Flux for example giving you a declarative cluster bootstrap And it looks like this Basically instead of running the Flux bootstrap command with all the combination of flags and so on you can write a custom resource and you can configure Flux in any way you want And it also allows a pure bootstrap from OCI artifacts right So it's no longer the Flux bootstrap command is also tied to Git When you use the the operator has no opinion You can point the operator to a registry you can point it to between this bootstrap process and the source of truth That was the first thing we've built in the operator A second thing is dynamic resource composition And we've introduced this API called resource set The idea here is that one of the I think one of the most requested feature in Flux in the last year was I don't want to merge changes and then look at the cluster and see what's going on I want to have the same workflow as we have now for code where you open a pull request CI does stuff runs my tests maybe builds my container And I don't want to merge anything I want Flux to deploy whatever was built in that pull request on a preview cluster or something like that And with this API we allow you to tell Flux operator hey scan my pull request if it has the label Flux preview take what's in there based on a template that the cluster admin has created that can spin up a new cluster using cluster API or use a namespace in an existing cluster deploy everything from the pull request there then go back to the pull request and tell people this is how I can access your app Maybe now you can start your end to end tests and we have this integration points and so on And we see major adoption of this new API And here is where we are putting a lot of effort and we are integrating with more Git services and so on This is how a resource set looks like It has an input provider where you define where your GitHub repo is and it should scan pull requests It also works with GitLab works with Azure DevOps and we keep expanding it And this is how the templating looks like It's a little bit of templating with some magic around it to make it simpler Okay Last thing AI So after we build the operator we decide okay now we have these top level APIs built on top of Now is the right time to expose them to AI systems And it's also part of the Flux operator project It's free You can use it with your own AI systems So the first of all when we build the MCP server what we've seen is that especially Cloud and other models are really good at Flux APIs They really understand them They can generate all the Flux configuration for you especially if you feed it the latest Flux docs So the MCP does that exposes the latest APIs in let's say a more compact form or more friendly form for the AI to how Flux works and all the other Kubernetes objects So it is really good for generating content But where we see the power of using the MCP is more around troubleshooting and root cause analysis And we've seen large Flux users using the MCP during incidents and so on with great success It will not be perfect It's AI It can't be perfect But it can be a huge shortcut to finding the root cause in complex systems This is how it looks You can run it locally We are now running the MCP server in cluster with OEDC authentication on top of it As I said it's really good at incident management And we've built some MCP tools specific in the server for debugging and incident management So instead of the Flux MCP server is not running the responses that it gives back are compacted And it also has hints for the AI to move forward and find the next problem in the chain and so on This is how you can do it This is how it looks all together There is a demo on the website You can try it out One last thing 30 seconds about security considerations You have to be careful with this stuff What we built in the MCP server was it cannot query Kubernetes secrets So it can touch everything in the API But when we serve the secret back there are no secret values only the keys in your Kubernetes secret And this is because it will definitely go into model training if you don't know what you're doing But of course if you put in your deployment environment variables good luck with that And we also build a read only mode into it So it is really good It can help you fix things But you can also delete your whole cluster So it has this read only mode I invite you to try it out and give us feedback It's early on We've seen a lot of adoption in this space enthusiasm But yeah there are many many ways on how you can bring down your whole system if you don't know how to use it Thank you very much Thank",
