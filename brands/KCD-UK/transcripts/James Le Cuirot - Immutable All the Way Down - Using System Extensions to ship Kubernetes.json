  "text": "Hello welcome to Immutable All The Way Down I'm James Lequereau better known in the community as Chewy I threw in a few ponies in my talk at the last minute because why not I'm a software engineer at Microsoft right here in Edinburgh In fact until March I used to work just down the street from here I'm a flat car container Linux maintainer by day and a gen2 Linux maintainer by night That's handy because flat car is based on gen2 I'm sure you're all sick of slides by now right Well you're lucky because this doesn't have any I've got four demos for you today We're going to provision kubernetes in a way that you might not have seen before For this we're going to use flat car You can use pretty much any distribution that has a systemd version newer than about four years old to do this Flat car is a community maintained distro It's a cncf project and it's designed for running container workloads What makes it special is it's immutable If you're not familiar with that it basically means you can't write to USR as root Even if you poke about with the block device the system will eventually notice and panic which is great for security not so good if you want to update or install packages But then you know do we want to be installing and updating packages on our production systems Maybe not You know these days not coddling pets but the cattle approach has some downsides so let's see if there's a middle ground So for the first demo I'm going to introduce you to the concept of systemd system extensions Second demo we're going to use systemd sysupdate to update the system extension The third demo we'll build on that to deploy a kubernetes cluster locally on this machine and the fourth demo combines all that but adds the kubernetes daemon to update things without disrupting your pod workloads and that will be done into Azure You can use any we'll use cluster API for that and you can use any provider that supports cluster API to do this like OpenStack or AWS might work So yeah now I'm sure some of you secretly enjoy your dessert before your main so we're going to start with demo four because that just takes a while actually So I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty of demo four It's there's quite a lot of code behind it but the relevant parts you'll see in the other demos So I'm just going to load up the code and I'm going to set up a kind cluster If you're not familiar with kinds it's basically kubernetes in a docker container useful for local testing and development and we're going to use that to then deploy our real kubernetes cluster in Azure So that's fired up so we'll get generating the cluster API YAML and that will take a while so we'll just leave that go Onto the first demo then So what is a sysx Well it's a file and what kind of file Well in this case it's a squashfs which is a compressed Linux file system You can have other forms of sysx They can just be x4 file systems The modern type is aerofs which has been designed specifically for this use case But yeah squashfs is the sort of traditional format And now these are immutable just like the immutable distros that you might run them on so it's cryptographically protected and you mount them on your system like any file system but they get overlaid on top of USR so it becomes part of your wider system and that's done using overlayfs which is a Linux kernel feature that's used to power docker and say live USB distros And you might think well that sounds a bit like a container Why don't you just use a container But there's some things you don't want to do in a container like kubernetes You're like wait Chewy didn't you just put kubernetes in a container of a kind Yes but not in production So although one of the people outside I gather they are putting kubernetes in a container but there we are You have options So we can mount this to have a look at it but we'll just use the squashfs tools So what's in this thing Well we've got kubadm kubectl kubelet various bits needed to make kubernetes work and some systemd stuff So these are static go binaries which makes this sysx pretty much usable on any distro but sysx can be specific to a distro and a release They might have you know dependencies on specific system libraries but generally you want to make them generic It really depends on your use case As such there's some metadata that goes with the sysx that's just a file inside it So we'll just take a peek at that This id field is designed to match the OS release and the XeOS release file but you can use a special string any which means it will work anywhere Obviously the CPU architecture can't be generic so we put that in there And that last line just tells systemd hey there's some systemd config in here so when you merge the sysx make sure you reload your config And we'll just take a peek at that config So there's a unit which we attach to the multi user target which is the general systemd unit for the system is running keep kubelet running which is what we want So just before we fire up Flatcar let's just see what that looks like So Flatcar ships images in a variety of formats This is the QMU one using sorry the QCOW2 for using the QMU and we include a shell script just to make it easier to fire that up And generally when you use Flatcar you want to provision it with some YAML which looks like this This gets passed to a provisioning tool called Ignition It's a bit like CloudInit if you're familiar with that but it's not written in Python It's fairly similar So this just basically says fetch this sorry hopefully you can see that Fetch the sysx from this web server which you'll notice is a local IP because I'm just going to run that on my machine and write it to this path The rest isn't strictly related but Flatcar normally updates itself after a short time and we don't want it to do that during the demo so I've disabled that and the rest is just to make the demo easier Now Ignition consumes JSON not YAML so we use a special tool called Butane just to convert it and that's done there Run the Python built in web server it can be any basic web server and we'll fire up Flatcar It's just the serial console coming up Excuse me Actually while that's coming up we'll just check on demo 4 Okay that's the first bit done Start deploying the cluster I was afraid that might happen This worked the second time I did it last time so we'll just cross our fingers and I'll come back to that Right so that's Flatcar up Doesn't take long to boot It's a very minimal distro So just run my script Oops sorry So let's see what we've got So it's put out a sysx it's downloaded it from the web server stuck it in that directory down the bottom there but systemd won't actually notice it yet because it's looking in etsy extensions So what we'll do is we'll create a symlink to that systex into that directory There we go Ask it again and there you can see it knows about it but it's not actually active yet So these are the ones that are active If we try and run say well try and check if Kubernetes is there it's not there Kubelet's not running So what we need to do is tell systemd to refresh because you don't want it to just apply the thing straight away when you're not ready You might need to take some initial steps first So we'll apply it now with the refresh subcommand A bunch of stuff happens So it's picked up our extension It's unmerged USR and remerged it with the extension So now we have Kubernetes there Kubelet's running It's broken That's only because we haven't configured it yet And yeah we can check the version Now just to highlight that was almost instantaneous There's no package installations going on here It's just literally flip one to the other But yeah that's the first demo done Shut that down Hooray Let's just see how that's going Try that again Might have to wait and see on the fourth demo That's the online one The rest is offline Okay We'll see how that goes Demo two So we're going to build on that and use systemd sysupdate to update the version of Kubernetes So here's our YAML again I did a few things So we're creating the symlink immediately now So it'll just be there And we're also including this sysupdate configuration file which I'll show you in a second And normally sysupdate runs on a timer but I've just disabled that so that I can demonstrate it a bit better And that next snippet I'll actually explain more in demo three YAML to JSON Now let's just look at what the web server's serving So we've got our old sysx there and our new one and the configuration file Just take a look at the configuration file Now you might think oh sysupdate's just for sysx It's not actually You can use it for anything But in this case sysx are regular files so that's what we tell it This is where we're writing them to This is where the symlink is This is where we're downloading them from And when it's looking for new versions this is the pattern it needs to match So we're matching that specific version of Kubernetes 1 33 whatever And the a matches the CPU architecture Now you might think oh is it just going to poke my web server just randomly looking for new versions No that would be silly So we have this char256sums file which lists all the sysx we have and includes a checksum which it can use to verify So fire up web server fire up Flatcar again Let's see how we're doing over here Maybe right Okay Run the script Okay So we've already got Kubernetes there on the old version Systemd already knows about it We've got the old sysx there not the new one yet Obviously the sysupdate hasn't done anything yet So let's fire it up So now you can see it's fetched the char256sums file and it's looked at that and gone oh there's a new version I'll grab that Let's see what it did That's quite a lot of stuff So basically what I just said But yeah downloading it swapping the symlink Let's have a look Got the old and the new there pointing at the symlink pointing at the new one Now it's Kubernetes is still actually when you run it it's pointing at the old one And again that's because we haven't done this refresh And this command will do the same thing but this is doing it through sysx systemd units just another way to do it and you issue a reload There we go That's demo two Let's see Demo four yeah okay So demo three is a little bit more involved We're going to have a control plane two worker nodes So let's look at the YAML for the control plane Now can see that we've got the same stuff we had before Got a little bit of network configuration here for an additional interface so it can talk to the other nodes in the cluster Kubernetes needs to know its own host name Otherwise it doesn't work Ignore that bit And we've got the sysupdate timer on this time but on quite an aggressive schedule so we're not having to wait for ages Now this bit at the bottom I don't like this This is horrible And I was looking into why is this like this and can I make it better I think with recent systemd versions they've made it possible But basically what this is doing is it's instead of just relying on systemd sysupdate to swap the same link we wanted to do a bit more than that this time and also write this reboot required file And this is one of the only ways to do that at the moment But yeah I think it could be done a better way But yeah I'll explain what that reboot required file is for in a And we've got a unit for kubadm which is to initialize the cluster just extend the timeouts and network config and blah blah blah Okay YAML to JSON web server Got some extra arguments on QEMU this time just to add that network adapter Also worth mentioning at this point the snapshot argument which we use to it tells QEMU not to persist its changes to disk So we can spin up as many VMs from this one image as we like and they'll all come up pristine which is very handy for demos So come just I'm scared to look at this now No change Oh man I don't know if it's worth just trying that again but we'll probably run out of time Right That's up Demo three Okay So when this is ready which it should be we'll write this directory with a config in it Good Got our control plane node It's not ready because we don't have a CNI yet Let's apply Calico Just give that a second to work Should see something Yep Okay Get nodes Right We're ready Check a little bit of pods Right Not quite ready There we go And that will have generated the token for us so the other nodes can join And we'll just write that token out to the handy little share that I've got where the other nodes can pick it up and we'll watch as these other nodes come up So this is the first worker Again similar YAML extra interface host name and kubeadm this time just joining the cluster instead of initializing it YAML to JSON Fire it up And while that's going we'll get the second one Same again So this should come up any second now There it is First node Second one should pop up There it is So what we'll do run my script Three So let's see what we've got So got the old sysext Same link as the old one The required file hasn't appeared yet So sysupdate hasn't kicked in yet Just give it a moment But while we're waiting what that's going to do well actually it's not going to do anything in this case but what we would use it for is with the likes of QOD which watches out for this file and it will then take action to mask your node evict all the pods move them elsewhere reboot apply the update effectively and then repopulate the pods And it will do all that automatically without disrupting your workloads and it's highly configurable I'll show you a bit of that in a minute Should be done by now Yep there's our file Sim link's updated and we can see that sysupdate did its thing So if we tell this to reboot and I'll do the same with the second one Probably should have checked that reboot required was there but never mind I forgot to do that Should be updated and hopefully the second one will follow There we go Updated again just like that So that's the third demo done and the fourth demo well Oh it looks like it's actually going to work this time Whether it'll be ready in time I don't know But basically what was going to happen there was it was going to deploy again control plane three worker nodes on the old version and then we were going to kubectl apply some QoD configuration and that has I'm not an expert on QoD but it has umpteam options to say how quickly do you want to update your nodes you know do you want a big delay between them how many to do at a time do you want to filter them what time of day do you want to do it and set up notifications and all this kind of thing and it will all just happen automatically So hopefully now you might reconsider immutable distros If you haven't now that you know you can use SysEx to provision them and update them very cleanly and quickly and safely Thank you Any questions",
