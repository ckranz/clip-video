  "text": "Today I'm going to be talking to you about kubernetes architecture As you probably know we should pick the random breakout session because you didn't know which one to But hopefully you chose me on purpose First a little bit about me I'm a senior systems engineer at Ticketline I do a bit of a mix of everything I'm not a kubernetes specialist but I like kubernetes a lot I did do a lot of kubernetes work at my previous employer Unfortunately me and kubernetes are no longer working together but that's neither of our fault particularly I'm really into vintage computers and trying to give back through speaking and volunteering and a bit of travelling and I want to start with a slide which represents what kubernetes was to me when I first met it I'd hardly done anything with docker and it just seemed like magic to be able to put some yammer in and get some applications out All I was doing was messing around doing trial and error trying to figure out why this worked and why this didn't work and taking absolutely no trouble at all to understand the terminologies around kubernetes or anything about it at all So I was incredibly lazy I worked until everything fell down It wasn't my fault I actually ended up fixing it but I learned a lot from the experience Mainly don't use complicated tools without trying to understand them I've got a few little things Firstly I'm going to talk about the mental model around kubernetes a little bit Then I'm going to talk a little bit about the theory of architecture and then a little bit about what actually happens when you put that yammer in inside that magical black box There are many kubernetes many little differences many different terminologies but there's one standard and that's what makes a kubernetes kubernetes Whether you're using renewal kubernetes or highly modified cloud provider kubernetes or a tiny little kubernetes assigned for the edge like K3S Kubernetes is a simple idea It's just a way of managing containers or as someone very aptly put it in a random AWS summit talk which I've now quoted and put in this presentation just distributed remote command execution But it's a complex system where it's whole own language of different things I think this is a big part of what makes it so hard to It's a massive jump from this world where everything is just computers with access steps And that analogy doesn't really work very well in because even with the way simplest cluster now this could technically be simple I could merge together the worker and the control plane but for diagrammical simplicity of sacrifice architectural simplicity So this analogy just doesn't work That's because it's a distributed compute system and it's a different analogy And to my mind kubernetes is a lot like a business In fact specifically it's a lot like my previous employer but we won't go there So you need the infrastructure so you need the factory you need the office and you need the managers You need the people to tell people what to do to think about what's being done and why it's being done And you need the worker nodes the minimum wage workers to work in the factory on the call center phones or in the warehouse And you need some way for all these people to In this case I'm just talking about container networking Don't think too much about that analogy please So firstly infrastructure So for me infrastructure has got four components You need the nodes and the actual physical stuff to make it all work If you're on a cloud provider then you don't really need to think so much about this You just need to kind of pick out how much capacity you need and what instance types provide it But it's important to understand what's actually going on in those instance types and what the work they're doing behind the scenes is So each one of these nodes need two fundamental things It needs a container one time to actually do the hard work and to be spoken to by Kubernetes to run containers It needs a Kubelet service which runs as a system D or other service on the system to translate the pod specs into As well as answer queries about the pods on the node and other such important things of course you need a deployment tool to bring it all together because Kubernetes is far too complex to deploy by hand A control plane is the critical management layer So it thinks about everything the cluster needs to do makes decisions It's assigned to run across multiple nodes The more the better within reason to remember what exactly is going on in the cluster And it's also where microservices are orientated which I absolutely love Because it's so cool that Kubernetes is run by containers for containers And everything except from Kubelet and the container one time are containerized microservices Though some are microservice monoliths but we'll get into that in Well and a bit is right now The first component is the control manager To me it's a bit like the HR management role rolled into one It monitors and it manages and it generally runs around being bossy It's kind of like a It's got many different processes that are just rolled into one And ones in the control plane the container It checks in on nodes reports across if they aren't functional or not responding And creating default services counts in namespaces It does what's and what's over things as well There's another variant of the control manager which is specifically for plugging into cloud instances It's an interface layer so that cloud providers can adopt Kubernetes without losing the interoperability So that you can run the same pods same services across AWS Azure and all the other cloud providers It's basically just the same idea but different jobs And so it's thinking about things that are a deeper layer from the control manager like asking the cloud if the nodes that have disappeared have actually been deleted on purpose And the API server is the way in which you speak to When you use kubectl you're speaking to the API server And it's also useful inside the cluster to find out information about the It's also a microservice It's just a fancy HTTPS server And it's the absolute critical hub in the hub and spoke network model of Kubernetes And then ECD ECD is a bit different from all the other things because those are all part of the Kubernetes project Whereas ECD is a separate open source project that just gets used by Kubernetes It runs in a distributed fashion normally across the master nodes but it could run on a separate cluster And probably will in more highly available environments it's not technically tied to Kubernetes in any way Its job is just to store all the data for the cluster So for instance it will store what pods are deployed what deployments are information about what nodes are in the cluster what the IP addresses are and stuff like that So the cluster can then restore from its stage whether to be a PowerPort or etc Finally the scheduler So it's a bit like project management It just takes newly created pods gives them some nodes to and it kind of thinks about which pods should run on which node based on many different factors Such as resource availability affinity etc Working age nodes the minimum wage workers of the Kubernetes world They're disposable They don't do any thinking They aren't important as individuals but they are important as a group because the cluster wouldn't be able to do any useful work without them one of their key functions as well as running the actual workloads is to run kube proxy which directs the traffic from world renowned IPs to the specific pods that are serving their services Finally container networking So the fundamental idea of the container network interface is to give every pod an IP address and then to provide networking services between them and the outside world as well There's a standard called the container network interface which specifies exactly what this should do and how it should talk to Kubernetes But there are many different ways to implement this standard and there are many different tiny little differences between them You have to choose which one and you have to install it which is very often a fruit gun when creating a real Kubernetes cluster Finally DNS So DNS isn't strictly necessary but most implementations of Kubernetes will have it because it means that you can resolve a service name to a service IP address And there are many different ways of doing it kube admin does it as two core DNS nodes on the clusters but cloud providers do their own thing And obviously it proxies DNS requests to external servers And there's lots of things I've left out here There's node communications there's authentication what you actually need to do to get this all to production and probably more that I haven't even thought of But this is kind of the gist of it And now to bring you on a little bit to talk a little bit about something more practical So this is a fairly simple YAML file to create three replicas of Nginx container It requires a deployment a replica set to keep the three pods as three pods not two pods or one pod or four pods And it says absolutely nothing about data or how to make it externally accessible And this is the gist of what actually happens when you try to deploy it So it starts with you using your tool to deploy it whether that is kubectl or that's a GUI tool or something else That tool sends a HTTP request to API server which will be authenticated Exactly how that works obviously depends on how you set things up An API server will create the objects in the ECD cluster so here we'd want a deployment object a replica set and three pod objects Kub scheduler will find their new pods without a node assigned and then it will make decisions about which worker should have those pods And then kubectl and the target nodes will receive instructions and pod specs to run those pods And then it will hand off to the container one time interface to actually do the work of running containers And once that's done the control managers will monitor and find out if those nodes have gone away And if so we assign a workload or if something happens to pods then new pods will be created to keep the replica set's three containers going And obviously as well as this you would normally have a service or you'd have volumes so that then the next day it was persisted And these can have their own separate processes but the first two things always happen no matter what you're deploying And that's me That was pretty fast as usual But yeah plenty of time for questions and discussion if you've got any Thank you",
