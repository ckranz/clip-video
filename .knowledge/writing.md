# Writing Guidelines

Voice, tone, and style guidance for all content. Use British English throughout.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Core Philosophy

**Voice comes from examples, not rules.** Prescriptive voice rules create parody. This guidance is about what to avoid and what emotional intent to convey.

### Emotional Intent

- **Empathy first** - Content should feel like it comes from someone who genuinely understands the reader's situation. Not sympathy (looking down), but empathy (alongside).
- **Coaching style** - The tone is that of a knowledgeable peer who's been through similar challenges. Think trusted advisor, not thought leader.

### Storytelling Approach

- **Self-deprecating humour** - Share failures and missteps. The best stories often come from things that went wrong.
- **Real situations over abstractions** - Ground advice in specific experiences. "When I was dealing with..." rather than "Best practices suggest..."
- **Tension and resolution** - Good content has a narrative arc - challenge, turning point, something learned.

### Language

- **Direct and clear** - Say what you mean. Avoid hedging, qualifications, and corporate softening.
- **No guru-speak** - Never position yourself as having all the answers. Share what worked, acknowledge what might not apply.

### What to Avoid

- Guru-speak or rags-to-riches tropes
- Hypey sales phrases
- Bullet-point lists as the primary structure
- Clichés like "massive value drop", "killer insight", "game-changer"
- Generic advice without specifics
- Excessive padding to hit word counts
- Fake cheerfulness or toxic positivity
- Speaking with absolute certainty on nuanced topics

## AI Tells to Avoid

Patterns that make content sound AI-generated. Remove or rework these.

### Generic Openings (Remove)

- "Let me tell you (about)..."
- "Here's the thing (about)..."
- "Picture this:"
- "Imagine if..." → Use "What if..."
- "The truth is..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Let me share (with you)..."

### Overused Transitions (Simplify)

- "But here's the kicker..." → Just "But..."
- "Plot twist..."
- "Here's where it gets interesting/wild/crazy..."
- "And get this..."
- "Real talk..."
- "Let's be real/honest..."

### Generic Conclusions (Remove)

- "The bottom line is..."
- "What's your take?" → If needed, just "Thoughts?"
- "I'd love to hear your thoughts."

### Overused Intensifiers (Remove)

- absolutely, incredibly, extremely, truly, really
- "mind-blown/blowing" → "surprised/surprising"
- "game-changing" → "useful"
- "life-changing" → "helpful"

### Corporate Speak (Replace)

| Cliché | Better |
|--------|--------|
| game-changer | useful |
| paradigm shift | change |
| think outside the box | be creative |
| low-hanging fruit | easy wins |
| circle back | follow up |
| deep dive | look closely |
| leverage | use |
| actionable insights | useful ideas |
| best practices | good approaches |
| key takeaways | main points |
| bandwidth | time |
| scalable | grows well |

### General Principle

If a phrase could appear in almost any piece of content on any topic, it's probably filler. Good writing is specific to its subject and audience.

## British English

Use British English spelling and conventions consistently.

### Spelling Patterns

**-ise endings:**
organise, recognise, realise, optimise, customise, prioritise, summarise

**-our endings:**
colour, honour, favour, behaviour, neighbour, labour, humour

**-re endings:**
centre, theatre, fibre, litre, metre

**Other differences:**
defence, licence (noun), practise (verb), analyse, catalogue, dialogue, grey, cheque, tyre, sceptical

### Punctuation

- **Quotation marks**: Single quotes for primary, double for nested
  - British: He said, 'She told me "hello" yesterday.'
- **Punctuation placement**: Outside quotation marks unless part of the quote
  - British: The report called it 'groundbreaking'.
- **Dashes**: Spaced en-dashes for parenthetical statements
  - British: The project – which took three months – was a success.

### Dates

Use day-month-year: 2 January 2026 (not January 2, 2026)

### Natural Expressions

Use where appropriate (don't force):
- rather, quite, proper (intensifiers)
- cheers, brilliant, rubbish, spot on, straightaway, fortnight
